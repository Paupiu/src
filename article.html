                    <h2>Cameron to consider beefing up bill on Scotland welfare and tax powers</h2>
                    <p class="byline">By Lachlan Hunt 14.5.2015 13:57</p>
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="images/politics.jpeg" alt="Meeting" width="620" height="372">
                    <h5>David Cameron and Nicola Sturgeon meet at Bute House in Edinburgh on Friday.</h5><br>

                    <p>David Cameron has offered to strengthen a new bill to give Scotland greater tax and welfare powers
                    after Nicola Sturgeon complained that the draft legislation failed to meet key pledges from the
                    Smith commission.</p>

                    <p>The first minister said their meeting in Edinburgh on Friday, the first between the two leaders
                    since the general election, had been "constructive and businesslike" after the prime minister
                    confirmed he would consider additional proposals to beef up Holyrood's tax and welfare powers.</p>

                    <p>Speaking after the meeting, Cameron told reporters that he would look again at the draft Scotland
                    bill to address cross-party complaints that it failed to honour "the spirit or the substance" of
                    the Smith commission proposals, agreed by the Tories in December. Holyrood's parties are annoyed
                    the draft bill watered down a promise that Scottish ministers could introduce new benefits or
                    increase existing ones – a criticism which Cameron appears to have accepted.</p>

                    <p>The prime minister said he could add extra powers going beyond the commission, which gives Scotland
                    nearly full control over income tax, air passenger duty and housing benefit.</p>

                    <p>He said: "I don’t rule out making sensible changes if sensible changes can be made. I made a
                    commitment that if I was prime minister, I would implement the Smith commission report in full
                    by introducing a Scotland bill in my first Queen’s speech. [It] was an agreement made in Scotland,
                    for Scotland, by Scottish parties."</p>

                    <p>Sturgeon has yet to set out which new powers her government plans to ask for and appears to be
                    rowing back on repeated demands during the election campaign for swift and urgent action to give
                    Scotland far greater financial and political autonomy in the UK.</p>

                    <p>Downing Street sources said no specific powers were set out in her meeting with Cameron, where
                    she offered instead to write to No 10 with a clearer shopping list at a later date.</p>

                    <p>Speaking after their meeting, Sturgeon told Sky News there were "priority powers, over and above
                    the Smith commission, that we wanted to see devolved". She said: "So what we are talking about
                    are business taxes, employment legislation, minimum wage and more powers over welfare."</p>

                    <p>Crucially, Sturgeon also confirmed that she is delaying further action on introducing
                    far-reaching tax and welfare powers which would take Scotland much closer to full fiscal
                    autonomy until after the new Scotland bill is enacted.</p>

                    <p>Those powers, known commonly as devo max but renamed full financial responsibility by the SNP,
                    were a key part of the manifesto which helped Sturgeon to a record-breaking landslide victory
                    in the general election, taking 56 of Scotland’s 59 Commons seats.</p>

                    <p>John McLaren, an economist with the Fiscal Affairs Scotland thinktank, said Sturgeon and her
                    ministers knew that Scotland’s economy was weakening with the recent collapse in North Sea oil
                    prices, making it much harder to raise enough taxes in Scotland to meet its much higher than
                    average public spending without having the Treasury’s financial support.</p>

                    <p>McLaren said the Scottish government’s own figures showed that Scottish GDP fell last year by
                    £55 per head in cash terms, while the UK’s GDP grew by £1,047 per capita. It was likely to worsen
                    this year with weak oil prices and tax breaks for North Sea operators hitting Scotland’s tax revenues.</p>

                    <p>Unless it raised taxes in Scotland to fund new welfare powers, Sturgeon’s government would need to
                    consider extra borrowing to cover additional spending – an issue not yet under discussion – and get
                    UK government agreement to amend the new Universal Credit welfare system.</p>

                    <p>"This is all very vague, post-Smith," McLaren said. "The most obvious way forward is for the UK
                    government to say you can borrow more up to a point, but not to put the UK’s position at risk.
                    No one has defined what a sensible level of borrowing would be."</p>

                    <p>Sturgeon's concession that she accepts the UK government’s timetable follows her claims in the
                    Scottish parliament on Wednesday that the Smith commission process could be delayed when she
                    suggested a new public review could be held.</p>

                    <p>"They must now agree with us a process that looks again at the Smith commission proposals,
                    with a view to extending devolution even further,” she told MSPs in a keynote speech about her
                    meeting with Cameron. “That must be a process that is made in Scotland – and one that involves
                    wider Scottish society."</p>

                    <p>That process was not raised at her meeting with Cameron and she confirmed afterwards that she
                    accepted the UK government’s timetable on introducing the new powers. "We undoubtedly will lay
                    down amendments to the Scotland Act [sic]," she said.</p>

                    <p>"What I’m hoping, though, is by time we get to the stage where the Scotland Act has been amended,
                    we might have made progress between the Scottish government and the UK government and have agreed
                    further ways in which we can go beyond Smith now. It remains to be seen whether we can do that."</p>

                    <p>Sturgeon admitted that reaching full financial responsibility, or fiscal autonomy, would take
                    some years. She said: "I want Scotland to be as empowered as possible in that respect. But,
                    you know, I recognise even if there was an agreement, which there’s not just now, to move to
                    full fiscal autonomy, that would take time to do."</p>
